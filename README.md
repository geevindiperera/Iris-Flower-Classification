# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

A neural network model built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The model achieves 93% accuracy on the test data and includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow 2.x: `pip install tensorflow`  
- Jupyter Notebook: `pip install notebook`  
- Additional Libraries:  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash

   https://github.com/geevindiperera/Iris-Flower-Classification.git

3. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
   cd Iris-Flower-Classification

4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
