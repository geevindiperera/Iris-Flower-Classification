# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

A neural network model built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The model achieves 93% accuracy on the test data and includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.

## Prerequisites
