# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

This project builds a neural network with TensorFlow/Keras to classify Iris flowers, achieving 93% accuracy. It includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix, precision, and recall
- Performance tracking and insights through detailed reports
